## How to Solve?

We initially tried a few common techniques:

When i tracking the road using view 360. i dont sure this pict taken on main road DT317. because round the photo taken is a lake / swamp. Meanwhile, on the main road DT317 is full of residential areas, and on the right side of the main road there is a large river. 

I assumed it might be on a small road. So I walked along the small roads around the main road until I found a location similar to where the photo was taken.
